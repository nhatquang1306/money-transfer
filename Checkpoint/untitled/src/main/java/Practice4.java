//Exercise 4: Start1
//        Create an integer method called Start1 that takes in two integer arrays "a" and "b". Start with 2 int arrays, a and b, of any length.
//        Return how many of the arrays have 1 as their first element.
//        start1([1, 2, 3], [1, 3]) â†’ 2
//        start1([7, 2, 3], [1]) â†’ 1
//        start1([1, 2], []) â†’ 1
