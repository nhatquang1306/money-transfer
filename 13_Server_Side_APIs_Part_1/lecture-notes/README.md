# Server Side APIs: Part 1

## Overview of session

In this lesson, you'll continue on with the previous day's lecture example of hotel reservations. You'll replace the fake server that you used in the previous example with a real one. If you follow the requirements that match the fake API, you can wire up that same client application and it'll work.

## Session objectives

- Describe the MVC pattern and why programmers use it
- Describe the purpose and scope of the Spring Boot / ASP.NET Core MVC framework
- Create a web application that accepts `GET` and `POST` requests and returns JSON
- Run a web application on a local development machine
