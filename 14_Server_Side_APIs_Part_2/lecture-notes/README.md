# Server-Side APIs: Part 2 Lecture

## Overview of session

In this lesson, you'll continue working with the hotel reservations example. Now that you've replaced the fake API server with a real one, you'll implement update and delete features, and return HTTP status codes.

The end result is a RESTful server with full CRUD capabilities. If you follow the requirements that match the fake API, you can wire up that same client application.

## Session objectives

- Understand the high-level architectural elements of the REST architecture
  - Explain how HTTP methods are used to interact with RESTful resources
  - Conform to RESTful conventions when using HTTP status codes
- Define CRUD and how it relates to HTTP methods and APIs
- Handle errors from backend code and alert the frontend that something has gone wrong through HTTP response codes
- Perform validation on client supplied request data
- Implement a RESTful web service that provides full CRUD capabilities
