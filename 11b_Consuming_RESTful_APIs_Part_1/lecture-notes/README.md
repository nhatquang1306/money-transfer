# Consuming Web APIs - GET

## Overview of session

The discussion for this lesson revolves around making an HTTP `GET` request. With that comes all the details about how the HTTP protocol works, the Protocol layers (IP/TCP/HTTP), and how those combine to enable communication between physically separated clients and servers.

The more focused discussion about HTTP expands into how the requests are made and how the responses are returned.
