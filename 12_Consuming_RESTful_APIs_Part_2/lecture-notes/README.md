# Consuming Web APIs - Part 2

## Overview of session

Today's lesson is a continuation of yesterday's lecture that covered HTTP and how to perform a basic `GET` request in a client / server application. This lesson covers `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` as well how to handle errors when they happen.

## Session objectives

- Implement Java or C# code that can send `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests that send data to the serverâ€”that is, the JSON request body
- Handle an error in network communication properly
- Handle a response containing a `4xx` or `5xx` status code
- Use Postman to make a `PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE` request
